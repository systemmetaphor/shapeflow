ShapeFlow is a model driven development engine that is unique because it can take anything as model. 
It allows you to implement DRY daily on those cases where generics, inheritance, components and other code reuse techniques either fail or introduce unwanted complexity. 

ShapeFlow lets you reuse what you already known and what you already have. 
Your database schema can be your model, you can add metadata to an YML file, to a json file, or you can parse your existing C# or VB code. 
Once you have a model you can write a model to text projection to generate source code.

ShapeFlow is an open source version of core technology used to build [MyTelecom](http://www.systemmetaphor.com).
